Service Injection TODO:

- Create a ‘character-detail’ component
    - place that component within ‘mat-sidenav-content’ inside the app.component.html file, 
        similar to how the `character-list` component is placed inside the `mat-sidenav` element.

- Inject the CharacterService into your `character-detail` component

- In your `character-detail` component.ts file, create a variable of type `Character`

- In the `ngOnInit` of your `character-detail` component, subscribe to the `activeCharacter` variable from the `CharacterService` and set the earlier created variable equal to the returned value.

- Display character details inside the `character-detail` .html file. 

- The `force-strength` component should be nested in the `character-detail` .html file.
